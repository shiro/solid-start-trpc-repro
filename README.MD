# Solid Start TRPC repro

There seems to be a bug in Solid Start when used with trpc that results in the server crashing on request.

This was reproduced by at least 1 other person on the discord, with node versions `18.6.0` and `20.8.0`, so the version is probably not relevant.

Some observations:

- works fine in dev, crashes only in production
- happens even if the `src/routes/api` directory is removed, so it's not related with the backend API code
- error goes away when the trpc query in the `src/routes/index.tsx` is removed - error probably happens when the trpc query is SSR-ed.
- crashes on both `renderAsync` and `renderStream`, but not `renderSync` (in `src/entry-server.tsx`)
- downgrading `@trpc/server` and `@trpc/client` by 1 version doesn't fix it
- happens with both `solid-trpc@0.1.0-sssr.8` (solid start build) and `solid-trpc@0.0.12-rc.3` (general build) - see the `trpc-beta` branch for the code


## Steps to reproduce

```
yarn
yarn build && yarn start
# go to 'http://localhost:3000/' and observe the server crashing
```

## Error output

```

 version  0.3.6
